# AI-DLC Recommendations & Decision Framework

## Decision Framework

For each decision point, provide:

1. **Recommended Approach**: Preferred option with specific reasoning
2. **Alternative Options**: Other approaches with pros/cons
3. **Decision Factors**: Key considerations (timeline, complexity, team skills, etc.)
4. **Risk Assessment**: Potential risks and mitigation strategies

## Recommendation Principles

- **Always provide specific recommendations** - Never ask "what should we do?"
- **Include reasoning** - Explain why one option is preferred
- **Present alternatives** - Give users informed choices
- **Consider context** - Team skills, timeline, complexity
- **Be decisive** - Have a clear preferred approach
- **NEVER fill decision answers** - Always leave decision fields blank for user input

## Template References

### Decision Records
**MANDATORY**: Use `.amazonq/templates/planning/decision-record-template.md` for creating decision records before plans.

### Plan Files
**MANDATORY**: Use `.amazonq/templates/planning/plan-template.md` for phases 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2. Use `.amazonq/templates/planning/implementation-plan-template.md` specifically for Implementation phase (2.3).

## Key Elements for All Plans
