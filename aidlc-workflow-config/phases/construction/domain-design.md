# 2.1 Domain Design

**Objective**: Apply DDD Tactical Design to create domain models using pseudocode
**Focus**: Entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events, business rules
**Important**: Use pseudocode for business concepts - avoid technical implementation

## Entry Point Requirements
**Can start this phase if:**
- [ ] `user-stories.md` exists from phase 1.1
- [ ] `domain-decomposition.md` exists from phase 1.2
- [ ] Architecture decision is documented
- [ ] Bounded contexts are clearly defined
- [ ] User stories are mapped to contexts

**Missing Prerequisites Handling:**
- Guide user to create missing artifacts using templates
- Offer to generate minimal versions from existing information
- Validate completeness before proceeding with domain design

## Required Context from Previous Phases

- **From 1.1**: User stories and business rules from `user-stories.md`
- **From 1.2**: Bounded context definitions and architecture decision from `domain-decomposition.md`
- **From 1.2**: Context boundaries and data ownership decisions

## Process

- **MANDATORY**: Use the domain design template at `.amazonq/templates/outputs/domain-design-template.md` for consistent modeling
- Apply DDD tactical patterns within each bounded context
- Define entities, value objects, and aggregates with clear business purpose
- Specify business rules in pseudocode format
- Identify domain events for inter-context communication
- Create repository interfaces for data access patterns

## Architecture-Specific Approach

### Microservices Architecture - Context Selection and Design

**Step 1: Context Selection (No Decision File)**
- Review bounded contexts from domain decomposition
- **Ask user directly**: "Which bounded context would you like to start with?"
- **Present options** with recommended priority:
  1. **{Context 1}** - {Brief description} (Recommended: Core business context)
  2. **{Context 2}** - {Brief description}
  3. **{Context 3}** - {Brief description}
- **Wait for user selection** - User responds with context name or number
- **No formal decision file needed** - This is a simple workflow choice

**Step 2: Domain Design for Selected Context**
- **Create domain design decision file** for the selected context only
- **Create domain design plan file** for the selected context
- **Execute domain design** for the selected context
- **File naming**: `domain-design-{context-name}.md`
- **Location**: `.aidlc/iterations/iteration-{N}-{feature}/outputs/construction/{context-name}/domain-design.md`

**Step 3: Context Completion Options**
After completing one context, ask user:
- **Option A**: Continue with next bounded context (repeat from Step 1)
- **Option B**: Proceed to Logical Design for completed context
- **Option C**: Proceed to Implementation for completed context

### Monolith Architecture
- **Create single domain design file** covering all bounded contexts
- **File naming**: `domain-design.md`
- **Location**: `.aidlc/iterations/iteration-{N}-{feature}/outputs/construction/domain-design.md`
- **Structure**: Organize by bounded context sections within the single file

## Context Selection Guidance

### Recommended Starting Priority:
1. **Core Business Context** - Primary value-generating domain
2. **Data-Heavy Contexts** - Complex entity relationships
3. **Integration Contexts** - External system connections
4. **Supporting Contexts** - Utility or administrative domains

### Context Selection Questions:
- Which context represents the core business value?
- Which context has the most complex business rules?
- Which context do other contexts depend on?
- Which context would provide the most learning for the team?

## Phase Transition Validation

### For Microservices (Per Context):
- [ ] Selected context domain design is complete
- [ ] All entities have clear business identity and purpose
- [ ] Value objects are properly defined with immutability
- [ ] Aggregates maintain proper consistency boundaries
- [ ] Business rules are expressed in pseudocode
- [ ] Domain events capture important business moments
- [ ] Repository interfaces defined for each aggregate
- [ ] **User decision obtained**: Next context OR proceed to logical design

### For Monolith:
- [ ] All bounded contexts covered in single file
- [ ] All entities have clear business identity and purpose
- [ ] Value objects are properly defined with immutability
- [ ] Aggregates maintain proper consistency boundaries
- [ ] Business rules are expressed in pseudocode
- [ ] Domain events capture important business moments
- [ ] Repository interfaces defined for each aggregate
