## 3. Project Structure

### 3.1 Directory Layout
```
{Choose structure based on architecture decision}

Microservices Structure:
project-root/
├── services/
│   └── [service-name]/
│       ├── src/
│       ├── tests/
│       └── package.json
├── shared/
└── frontend/

Monolith Structure:
project-root/
├── src/

### 4.3 Architecture Diagram
```mermaid
{Choose diagram based on architecture pattern}

Microservices Example:
graph TD
    A[Frontend<br/>[Framework]] --> B[API Gateway<br/>[Technology]]
    B --> C[Service 1<br/>[Purpose]]
    B --> D[Service 2<br/>[Purpose]]
    C --> E[Database 1<br/>[Type]]
    D --> F[Database 2<br/>[Type]]

Monolith Example:
graph TD
    A[Frontend<br/>[Framework]] --> B[API Layer<br/>[Technology]]
    B --> C[Business Logic<br/>[Services]]
    C --> D[Data Layer<br/>[ORM/Repository]]
    D --> E[Database<br/>[Database Type]]
```

### 4.4 Component Overview

### 4.5 Data Flow
1. **User Action**: [What user does]
2. **Frontend Processing**: [How UI handles it]
3. **Backend Processing**: [How API/services handle it]
4. **Data Operations**: [How data is stored/retrieved]
5. **Response Flow**: [How results return to user]

## 5. Backend Design

### 5.1 API Specification
| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | User Story | MVP |
|----------|--------|---------|------------|-----|
| [/api/resource] | [GET/POST/etc] | [Business purpose] | [US-001] | ✅/❌ |

### 5.2 Data Models
| Entity | Key Attributes | Relationships | User Story |
|--------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| [EntityName] | [id, field1, field2] | [Related entities] | [US-001] |

### 5.3 Business Logic
- **[ServiceName]**: [Business responsibilities and rules]
- **[RepositoryName]**: [Data access responsibilities]
- **[ValidatorName]**: [Validation rules and constraints]

### 5.4 Error Handling
| Error Type | Handling Strategy | User Experience | User Story |
|------------|------------------|-----------------|------------|
| [Validation Error] | [How system handles it] | [What user sees] | [US-001] |
| [Authentication Error] | [How system handles it] | [What user sees] | [US-002] |
| [System Error] | [How system handles it] | [What user sees] | [All] |

## 6. Frontend Design

### 6.1 UI Components
| Component | Purpose | Key Props | User Story |

| Flow | Steps | Components Involved | User Story |
|------|-------|-------------------|------------|
| [FlowName] | [Step1 → Step2 → Step3] | [Component1, Component2] | [US-001] |

### 6.3 State Management
- **Global State**: [What data needs to be shared across components]
- **Local State**: [What data stays within individual components]
- **API Integration**: [How frontend communicates with backend]

## 7. Integration Design

## Template Usage Notes
1. Replace all `[placeholders]` with actual design decisions
2. Reference decision records for technology choices
3. Focus on **what** to build, not **how** to implement
4. Ensure every user story maps to technical components
5. Address non-functional requirements in technical design
6. Keep implementation details minimal - focus on design
7. Validate completeness before proceeding to implementation
