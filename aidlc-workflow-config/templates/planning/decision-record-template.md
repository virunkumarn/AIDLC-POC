## Template Usage Notes
1. Replace all `[placeholders]` with actual values
2. Add as many decisions as needed for the phase
3. **NEVER fill in "Decision" fields** - Leave blank for user input
4. **NEVER auto-select options** - Present options without choosing
5. Fill in "Decision", and optionally "Additional Rationale/Consequences" ONLY when user provides answers
6. Update status to ✅ Decided when all decisions are made
7. Use this record as input for creating the plan file

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Decision Process Rules
- **AI Role**: Present options with recommendations
- **User Role**: Make all decisions by filling in "Decision:" fields
- **Never Auto-Fill**: Decision fields must remain blank until user input
- **Wait for User**: Don't create plan until all decisions are made
