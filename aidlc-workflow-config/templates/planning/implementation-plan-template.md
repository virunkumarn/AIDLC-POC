# Implementation Plan: {Project Name}

**Template Usage**: Use this template specifically for Implementation phase (2.3). For all other phases, use the generic `plan-template.md`.

## Status: 🔄 Planning | ⏳ Approved | 🚀 In Progress | ⏸️ Paused | ✅ Completed | ❌ Blocked

## Objective
Implement MVP features with runnable UI components and end-to-end functionality.

## Decision Reference
**Based on decisions from**: [../decisions/05-implementation.md]

## User Story Mapping (MANDATORY)
**Source**: Reference user-stories.md from phase 1.1

### MVP User Stories (Must Implement)
- [ ] **{US-001}**: {Story title} - {Brief description}
- [ ] **{US-002}**: {Story title} - {Brief description}
- [ ] **{US-003}**: {Story title} - {Brief description}

### Future User Stories (Post-MVP)
- [ ] **{US-004}**: {Story title} - {Brief description}
- [ ] **{US-005}**: {Story title} - {Brief description}

**Validation**: Ensure all MVP user stories from requirements are listed above.
